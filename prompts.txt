this is the data available for all the rivers across austrlia 
the thing is 
rivers are one of the major reason for water detahs in australia

my idea id we have four particular parameters realted to the named river
can we do something related to riversafety.
can we calculate the overall risk ? or predicting risk in season wise? or predicting risk on the paricular date/week/month?
also whatecer we do it must backed by some paper or some proven thing not just randomly

this is just ideation phase 
do not give any code as of now.
